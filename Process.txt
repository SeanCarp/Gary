Flow:
User input -> 
	Intent Classifier ->
		NER (Named Entity Recognition) -> 
			Code Execution ->
				Result (from API) ->
					Rule Based NLG (Natural Language Generation)

Also possible
Adding tone to training data and training a transformer to use the tone when giving a response. Also detecting tones from speech that will get treated as the input. Lastly, a memory bank of all responses from the user that will get retrained over time to get a more specified experience.
